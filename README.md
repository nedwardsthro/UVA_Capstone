Albemarle County Public School District implemented a cultural training program in 2015 for classroom teachers. Our question was to determine whether the cultural training program had an impact on students’ growth and actual achievement on standardized tests. By using linear regression, gradient boosting regression, and Kruskal-Wallis tests, we were able to identify that the program did make an impact on students’ growth and actual achievement; however it was not the most important factor. The students that had the highest increase in scores came from teachers that had the highest tenure and a higher degree.
